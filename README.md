# Speed-Route-Path-Finder
Speed Route - Path Finder is gives a hassle-free and quick solution to their queries about distance between two cities and path to reach them. It is easy to understand and use, and can be a major time saver for many people who avoid checking multiple websites for searching for shortest path between two places. Its working is pretty simple and direct and gives optimal solution to the problem.

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to provide users with the shortest and fastest route to their destination. By using advanced algorithms and techniques learnt till now, the project aims to provide accurate and reliable route recommendations that save users time and reduce stress levels associated with traffic.

## Concepts Used:
    Object Oriented Programming
    Class and Objects
    Data Structure and Algorithms
    Dijikstra Algorithm
    Graph

## Features of the Project
• Printing the map of cities
• Displaying minimum distance to all cities from the source city
• Displaying minimum distance from source city to destination city
• Print the shortest path from source to destination city
• Calculate and print time taken to travel between two cities using different modes of transport (bike, car, bus, train etc).

## Brief
You are given a map of connectivity between different cities. 
This map is represented in form of  graph. Each node of this graph denotes a city and weight of edge between two nodes is the distance between them. User will enter any number out of 1, 2 and 3. 

On entering 1, you have to display the graph.

On entering 2, take the source and desired destination of user as input and print the shortest path from source city to destination city. Also print the shortest possible path between them.

Lastly if the user enters 3, print the time it will take to travel from source city to destination city by different modes of transport. Mode of transport can be anything like bike, car, train etc.

If the user enters any number other than 1, 2 and 3, then output is an appropriate message which tells user that the data entered is invalid.
